In order to run the program, you must have the training and testing data in the following directories:
    data\mnist_train.csv
    data\mnist_test.csv

After ensuring a proper project structure the code may be ran, feature extraction will take at least a minute depending on computer hardware,
and when completed it will display the time it took for feature extraction. After this is shown in the console the program will then begin fitting 
and predicting using the various models, this will also likely take at least a minute and should not be cancelled until the 
final evaluation metrics are shown.
